# Django-Online-Marketplace-Project

As the culmination of my Django framework course with Meta, I've developed a dynamic restaurant website that offers a seamless experience for customers and efficient tools for admins. Customers can easily make reservations and gain insights into the restaurant's atmosphere. Admins have the power to manage the menu, handle reservations, and create privileged groups for enhanced customer experiences.
